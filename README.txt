Read me first!

The bayesianCurveFitting.py has two main functions.

bayesian(): implements the function of Bayesian Curve Fitting.
draw(): implements the function of drawing the figure

Use Spyder or any python complier to run bayesianCurveFitting.py

As you change the number of input, the function would check weather the csv file has enough data for you, if not, the function will break and type error for you which means you should re-write the number of input.
